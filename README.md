# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

This weeks challenge was to build a professional portfolio from scratch. To accomplish this I used advanced CSS techniques such as; flexbox, media queries, pseudo-elements and CSS variables. Right now the portfolio consists of welding work I've done but I will be able to add to it as the course progresses.

What I learned from this challenge has helped me greatly in understanding HTML and how to style them with CSS. Using advanced CSS techniques has taught me that the first solution isnt always the best option.
